# ![AllTrans](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhilkedia/AllTrans/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-hdpi/ic_launcher.png)AllTransâ„¢ - Completely Translate Apps

Like Chrome's translation of webpages, but for Android apps. It replaces **ALL TEXT IN AN APP** from one language to another at runtime.

Say for example an app is in German. A user selects the app name, and the required language conversion (say German to English).
Then whenever the user uses the required app, all the text, **ANYWHERE** in the app, are replaced by their English equivalents.
This is something similar to the way Google Translate works in Chrome.

Works with Android 11!

## What AllTrans does

It replaces **all text in an app** in a language from one language to another at runtime.

Say for example an app is in German. A user selects the app name, and the required language conversion (say German to English).

Then whenever the user uses the required app, all the text, **ANYWHERE** in the app, are replaced by their English equivalents.

This is something similar to the way Google Translate works in Chrome.

**Note** - Due to a technical limitation, this won't work with many games. Nothing can be done about this.

1. Sign up for a Microsoft Azure account.
If you don't already have an Azure account, sign up for a [Microsoft Azure account](http://azure.com).

## Note - No New Yandex Translate Keys

A previous version of this application encouraged use of Yandex API keys. Yandex has stopped giving free translate API keys. If you already have a key, it may continue to work, it may not. It is recommended to shift to using a Microsoft API key.

## TroubleShooting

### No app is being translated in any app

- If no app is being translated, check if "AllTrans" is enabled in "Xposed Installer -> Modules"
  - If you are using "Taichi", check "AllTrans" is enabled in "+ -> Manage Modules".
  - If you are using "Taichi"/"VirtualXposed", also make sure the app to be translated in installed using "Taichi"/"VirtualXposed".
- If you are using "Google" to translate (the default), make sure you have set "Translate From Langauge" and "Translate To Language" and downloaded the translation files.
- If you are using "Microsoft" to translate, make sure "Microsoft Subscription Key" is correct, and the "Resource Region" setting is "Global" when you made the key.

### Translated app is stuck in opening screen

- If this is the first time you started translating this app, click on the app's name in "Apps to Translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Replcaing With Translated Text" to "2000".

### The Translated app is "Force Close"

- Click on the app's name in "Apps to Translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Replcaing With Translated Text" to "2000".
- Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Starting to Translate WebViews" to "2000".

### Other apps are being translated, but some particular app is not

- Click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and in "Other Settings" fill in "Delay Before Starting to Translate WebViews" to "2000".
- If some parts of the app are still not being translated, click on the app's name in "Apps to translate" tab, and enable "Aggressive Mode".

### A game app is not being translated

- Due to technical limitations, "AllTrans" will not work with many games. Nothing can be done about this.

### The app "Telegram" is not being translated

- In "Apps to Translate", click on "Telegram", click "OverRide Global Settings", set "Translate From Langauge" and "Translate To Language", and **Enable "Aggresive Mode"**

### If you still have problems like "Force Close" or parts of an app not being translated

Contact me for support. When you do, I will need atleast the following information -

1. The name of the app, along with a **link to download the app** from some APK store like "Google Play Store", "CoolApk", etc.
1. Your phone's Android version.
1. A "logcat" of you trying to open the app which gives you problems. You can use apps freely available on the Play Store for this, such as [This one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nolanlawson.logcat)

Once you have the above, contact me on the  [XDA support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xposed-alltrans-completely-translate-t3539878).
You can also report issues on the  [Project's "Github"](https://github.com/akhilkedia/AllTrans).
